This is just a proof of concept to test how much load we can handle without optimization.

If we're out of PoC status we'd need:

- Better organized folder structure
- Proper security measures
- Maybe design some landing page if you go to the site in a browser
- Maybe switch to setup.py instead of requirements.txt
- Linting + other CI stuff
